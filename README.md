# NYPD-Stop-and-Frisk

In this project, we examine the infamous policy of the New York Police Department, Stop and Frisk, between the years 2003 and 2012. Stop and frisk, in its implementation, was a two-step process: first, an individual was stopped by the police force and, if the individual was thought to be suspicious, would subsequently undergo frisking. Given over three-and-a-half million data points of police stops and 113 features, we obtained an accuracy of 68% with both the Decision Tree and Naive Bayes classfiers.

In this Jupyter Notebook, we begin with exploratory data analysis to understand our dataset, continue with feature selection and feature engineering, and end with the implementation of a decision tree classifier and a Naive Bayes classifier. These classification algorithms were used to predict the liklihood of frisking, given that an individual had been stopped by the police.
